# Ruxn - A Stack Ordinator in Rust

This is my attempt to write the stack ordinator [Uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxn.html) in Rust, to see
if most of its operatations can be written in a memory-safe way, and moreover to document the design of the Uxn project.

This is the Uxn system as I understand it.
